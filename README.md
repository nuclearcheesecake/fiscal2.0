# Background

Looking back at my start as a programmer - this was my first real project. Nostalgia. Doubts as a programmer, daunting task. Endless nights.

Background on module and task

At the same time, I was busy with another module in Graphical User Interfaces, where we created small apps in Visual Studio 2017 using C#. Quickly the idea formed to streamline the user experience using this technology, instead of Excel which, albeit powerful, did not have the interface functionality I desired.

Thus the **Financial Solidarity Calculator**, or FISCAL, was born. 

User Experience (UX) was a big focus for me, and the design was always kept in mind when coding. The decision to move to C# is justified then, looking at the...interesting design capabilities I had in Excel at the time.

# Conclusion

In the end, I scored 95% for this assignment, and was pleased that my first rabbit hole into application programming was recognised.

At the inter-campus competition, FISCAL 2.0 obtained a second place. I am proud of my silver medal - it proved to me that coding only needs guts and an internet connection to master.
