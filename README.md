# Background

Looking back at my start as a programmer - this was my first real project. Nostalgia.

Background on module and task

At the same time, I was busy with another module in Graphical User Interfaces, where we created small apps in Visual Studio 2017 using C#. Quickly the idea formed to streamline the user experience using this technology, instead of Excel which, albeit powerful, did not have the interface functionality I desired.

Thus the **Financial Solidarity Calculator**, or FISCAL, was born. 

User Experience (UX) was a big focus for me, and the design was always kept in mind when coding. The decision to move to C# is justified then, looking at the...interesting design capabilities I had in Excel at the time.
